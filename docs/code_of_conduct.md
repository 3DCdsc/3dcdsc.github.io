## 3DC Code of Conduct
As a member of the 3DC organization, you are part of a club that endeavours to further the programming community in SUTD where students can learn, explore, build and create free from harassment or abuse of any form.

**Our Pledge**

As a member of 3DC, I pledge to make participation in our community an experience free from harrassment and abuse for all students regardless of race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, level of experience and education level. I pledge to do my utmost to espouse the values of the club as well as abide by the SUTD Honour Code.

**Our Standards**

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

-   Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward learners of varying backgrounds
- Asking questions that benefit other student learners
-   Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Asking other members politely if you are obstructing their learning experience
-   Keeping feedback constructive

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

-   Making sexual advancements of any kind

-   Insulting or derogatory remarks, and personal or political attacks
-   Public or private harassment
-   Doxxing, publishing othersâ€™ private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
-   Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting
