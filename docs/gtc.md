After you have finished any of our GTC workshops (Web, Android, Cloud or Telebot), you may submit your prototype/work you have done (either during or after workshops).

We are not expecting finished products or anything like that! Just apply the concepts you have learnt and show us what you've accomplished, you may stand to win a prize!

The scoring rules and criteria are as follows:

1. Use **at least one of the technologies from our workshops** (Web, Android, Cloud, Telebot), but you are free to use any other technologies in conjunction as well.
2. Do not submit projects/work that has been started for some time already (i.e. no cheating)!
3. We want to see good implementations of **concepts learnt** (can be on your own or during workshops)! Be creative!
4. If you have multiple pieces of prototype/work (e.g. different workshops), please submit them together. Implementing **multiple technologies** well may help you score higher!
5. Bonus points for **cool ideas**
