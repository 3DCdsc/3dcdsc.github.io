# Day 2: Firebase Auth

In this section, we shall learn to add a login system for our app, so that users can login from other devices, and multiple users can also login from the same device! 

Together with Realtime Database (which we cover in another section), we will be able to allow users to save pets online, and access their pets from any Android phone!
